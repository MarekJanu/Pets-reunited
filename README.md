# Pets-reunited by Manc-rosoft

## _Introduction_

Our project is designed to help reunite lost pets with their owners quickly and easily. Losing a pet can be a very stressful and emotional experience, but with our app, you can report your lost pet and search for found pets in your local area.

Pets-reunited is a mobile app developed using React Native and Firebase. It is the final group project that we have created during the Northcoders bootcamp in software-development. The main goal of our venture was to design and develop - top to bottom - a working app using a new tech stack that we were not familiar with. We decided to use React Native to produce something for IOS and Android platforms, we also choose to implement Google services: Firebase, Google Autocomplete and Maps _(Geocoding API, Places API)_. The process of development was conducted using Agile methodology, with daily morning stand-ups, sprints and task alocation via Kaban boards.
